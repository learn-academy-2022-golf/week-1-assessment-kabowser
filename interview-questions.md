# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is the local data that has been saved on to my machine, Github is where different branches can be submitted onto a server to be merged to the main branch.

Researched answer: Git is very commonly seen as version control, won't allow edits to be merged onto the main branch unless approved. Keeps code from breaking. Github is a cloud based system that keeps a true copy of the main. This allows us to code and test our code without altering the true branch

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value? 

Your answer: Boolean is one of the six primitive data types, that will result in a true or false answer.

Researched answer: The &&(both side must be true 10 === 10) and || operators will return a true or false value.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: Index is a term that is used to reference in a string or an array what value is at the specific location from left to right. The first vale is always a zero index. Value is what is actually contained in the index "slot" or position. Must be a data type that is recognized by JavaScript. Ex: "Hello"   H is at the index of 0, the value at the 0 index is "H"

Researched answer: Index has multiple uses or meanings, for example in loops we assign the index as i. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: String is data that is surrounded by '', "", or ``. Arrays are different in the fact that it is a collection of data types. Both share many common built in methods. They both also a indexed and start at the zero index.

Researched answer: Array is a collection of ordered data that has 5 parts. Both arrays and strings consist of elements. Arrays are annotated by []brackets while strings are annotated by "".

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming consists of one navigator and one driver. Each take turns swapping out of roles to allow the other a nice break from coding. Navigator is the one who essentially is in charge and responsible for what the driver is coding. They also help double check for mistakes and typos. This helps reduce the amount of mistakes made and eliminates alot of silly errors. Having two sets of eyes on one code. Gives a sense of direction for the driver. The driver is the one who is like a Co-pilot typing or coding what the navigator is giving directions/ explanations about. Some good practices are to communicate clearly, work on not being frustrated, and to recognize when things aren't working as a pair and to make suggestions like maybe a 5 minute break etc. Respect is always needed and it's nice to have a partner who works with you rather than just sitting there. Personal experience has already shown me night and day difference with a good communicating partner. With a good pair programing partner much more work can be done in a shorter period of time.

Researched answer: It is a technique in which two programmers work collaboratively to reach the same goal, or accomplish the same task by coding together.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-order functions are built in methods in JavaScript. They are a specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an argument. Designed to operate on arrays.


2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. The Jest framework is made up of a collection of files called dependencies which contain snippets of code functionality. Using all these code snippets together in the right way will give us the ability to run tests. There are many dependencies to manage and all need to work together in exactly the right way.

3. Objects: Objects consist of collections of key:value pairs stored in curly braces. The key is a data type of symbol and the value is any valid data type in JavaScript.

4. Method: When a function belongs to an object it is called a method

5. Classes: Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Just like functions, classes have their own scope.
